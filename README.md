## Hi there, I'm Margarida!

ðŸ’¡ I'm currently a **master's student** at UA (Universidade de Aveiro, Portugal), majoring in Data Science for Social Sciences!

ðŸ’­ Iâ€™m passionate about **using data to make cities smarter, fairer, and more livable**. Iâ€™m especially interested in how data can help us improve **mobility, accessibility**, and **urban inclusion**, always with people at the center. I care about projects that use technology not for its own sake, but to solve real problems, reduce car dependency, and **create cities that are connected, sustainable, and built for everyday life**. Like Jane Jacobs said:

    "There is no logic that can be superimposed on the city; people make it, and it is to them, not buildings, that we must fit our plans."

During my bachelorâ€™s and masterâ€™s studies, Iâ€™ve worked on projects related to **perceptions of insecurity in urban spaces**, **renewable energy communities**, and **accessibility assessment**. These are all topics I deeply align with and hope to explore further in the future!
